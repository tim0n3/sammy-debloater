No-Root Debloat script for Samsung android phones

The reason the sdb uninstall command is using the `-k --user 0` switches so that the app is only removed from the current user so that you have the option to reinstall it or have it re-load if you're factory resetting the phone if you've given it / sold it to someone else.

You can expect to gain about half-a-day's worth of battery life (in lite-use cases) (I get about 2.5 days [50-60 hours] battery life since the debloating in normal mode with 120 Hz display enabled)
